# Lab 8 - Starter

1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

Answer: 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed: I want to to test my code everytime I push changes to my repo to ensure that that new code does not break the existing code. Github Actions will help me automate my testing process so I do not have to run the tests manually everytime I push changes to my repo.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

Answer: No.
